  A key vendor demanded a 40% price increase with only 2 weeks 
  before our contract expired. No immediate alternatives were 
  available in the short term.

  facts:
    - Vendor demanding 40% price increase
    - Contract expires in 2 weeks
    - No alternative vendors available short-term
    - Current service is critical for operations
    - Budget for this year is already set
  
  emotions:
    - Frustrated
    - Pressured
    - Anxious about timeline
  
  stakeholders:
    - Vendor representative
    - My team
    - Budget owner
    - Operations department
  
  constraints:
    - 2 week deadline
    - Fixed annual budget
    - Dependency on current service
  
  timeline: 2 weeks until contract expiration

stakes: high
domain: professional

# What actually happened
actual_decision: |
  Agreed to the 20% increase after one round of negotiation,
  without fully exploring alternatives or documenting the process.

actual_outcome: |
  Budget overrun for the quarter. Lingering regret about not 
  having time to find alternatives. Vendor now has leverage
  for future negotiations.

# Personal reflection
reflection_notes: |
  I felt pressured by the timeline and didn't take enough time
  to step back and think strategically. The emotions drove
  the decision more than the principles should have allowed.

lessons_learned:
  - Should have invoked SOP 6 (Consequential Pauses) despite time pressure
  - Should have triangulated with trusted advisors before deciding
  - Need to build buffer time for contract renewals going forward
  - Consider Principle 43 (Leverage Neutral Structures) - written contracts
